This is an W.I.P. musical note identifier.

It is built using an ESP32 Nano on the Arduino platform.

The point of this project for me is to get better at programming in C/C++ and to learn more about using microcontrollers for signal processing.

Currently, it has a very limited range for frequency identification, but I am working through it to fix this issue.

By the end of this project, my goal is for this to become efficient and accurate enough to be used as an instrument tuner.
